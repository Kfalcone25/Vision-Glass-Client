            You might talk about your origin story, your team, highlight awards
            or recognitions, or share photos. Tap into your creativity. You’ve
            got this. The way you tell your story online can make all the
            difference.

          <p>
            Don’t worry about sounding professional. Sound like you. There are
            over 1.5 billion websites out there, but your story is what’s going
            to separate this one from the rest. If you read the words back and
            don’t hear your own voice in your head, that’s a good sign you still
            have more work to do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be clear, be confident, and don’t overthink it. The beauty of your
            story is that it’s going to continue to evolve and your site can
            evolve with it. Your goal should be to make it feel right for right
            now.
